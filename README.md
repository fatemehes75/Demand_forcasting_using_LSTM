# Demand_forcasting_using_LSTM

In order to meet customer demand effectively, it is essential for retailers to consistently engage in dynamic planning activities. The key to this planning is the generation of precise demand forecasts, which enable retailers to anticipate the specific inventory requirements for each store location. These forecasts play a crucial role in maintaining sufficient product availability for customers, while simultaneously minimizing the associated stock risks.

To achieve these goals, the project will leverage Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technology, which is particularly well-suited for handling time-series data and is widely recognized for its effectiveness in forecasting applications.

Steps:

1. Importing Libraries
2. Dataset Gathering
3. Data Wrangling
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Model Development 
6. Model Evaluation



Achievements: 
* Developed and implemented an LSTM model to generate precise demand forecasts for retail stores, effectively anticipating inventory requirements and reducing stock risks. 
* Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis to uncover insights into sales trends, and sales distribution across stores and items, enabling data-driven decision-making for inventory management.
